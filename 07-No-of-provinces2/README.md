# üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª547. Number of Provinces

[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/)

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

 

Example 1:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:

Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 200
n == isConnected.length
n == isConnected[i].length
isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
isConnected[i][i] == 1
isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
```
